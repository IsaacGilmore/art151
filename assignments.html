      <h3 id="fanpage">Fanpage Project</h3>
      <p>Using HTML and CSS create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansite">fanpage</a> for anything you want. It could be as traditional as a celebrity page, something as mundane as a chair, or something as specific as a page devoted to cats riding
        roombas.
      </p>
      <p>Requirements</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At least 4 separate pages</li>
        <li>Use styles in a .css file</li>
        <li>Must include media of some sort on each page (images, video, audio)</li>
        <li>Host on github</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3 id="p5">p5 Project</h3>
      <p>Using a combination of variables, images, for loops, animations, conditionals, statements, text, color, etc. create an application that uses keyboard and mouse user input. This can be an animation, a simple game, a drawing machine type app.</p>
      <p>Requirements</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One for loop</li>
        <li>Two conditional statements</li>
        <li>Mouse input</li>
        <li>Keyboard input</li>
        <li>Upload to a github respository</li>
        <li>Add at least one still image and a description to your github repository readme</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3 id="narrative">Web Narrative Project</h3>
      <p>Using p5, HTML, and CSS create an interactive narrative web app that uses interactive elements such as sliders, buttons, color, clicks, text boxes, etc. The narrative can be whatever you want, from something as ordinary as a commute, to something
        imagined like an alien invasion, or a narrative that endlessly loops to mess with a viewers idea of time and space. </p>
      <p>For the project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a minimum of 5 different 'scenes' that are triggered by different interactions</li>
        <li>Use a minimum of 3 different HTML input elements to progress the narrative, e.g. buttons, sliders, links, selects, etc. </li>
        <li>Every scene should have an interactive element on the page</li>
        <li>Upload to a github respository</li>
        <li>Add at least one still image and a description to your github repository readme</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3 id="">Advanced p5 Project</h3>
      <p>Using p5, p5 libraries, and JavaScript libraries make a more complex interactive application. Utilize one of the libaries discussed in class or another you are interested in to create an application that moves beyond the browser - user relationships
        we have made so far (webcam, audio, machine learning, etc). </p>
      <h4>Proposal</h4>
      <p>A typed 1-2 page proposal with a drawing, sketch, mockup due via email. In your proposal discuss what you would like to work on for your final project, why you want to produce this, and your conceptual reasoning behind wanting to create the work.
        Include a breakdown of the steps to complete your project and an approximate timeline for completing the steps. Each student will meet with me individually to discuss their proposal and to get feedback.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h3 id="final">Final Project</h3>
      <p>Drawing inspiration form artists we have viewed in class and using any of the techniques we have covered in the course, create a more developed project. This can be a significant expansion of a previous project or a completely new project. Your
        project can be a game, an interactive narrative, an interactive 'installation', a webcam app, a data driven app, or a combination of any of these. This is an opportunity to connect your personal interests with the course content in a way that
        is interesting to you.</p>
      <p>You can use whatever software you want, as long as it adheres to the following guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic functionality: use callbacks, booleans, conditionals, and interactivity (mouse, keyboard, webcam, etc.) to create a dynamic project. The key here is to use HTML/CSS, JavaScript (p5) to trigger levels, scenes, aesthetics, etc.</li>
        <li>Use at lease one piece of media (image, video, sound)</li>
        <li>Submit a link of your github repository before critique date</li>
      </ul>
