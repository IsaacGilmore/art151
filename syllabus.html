    <h1>SYLLABUS</h1>
    <p class="notice">This schedule is subject to modification. Activities are subject to change based on the progression of the course. No due dates / readings / homework will be changed without prior notification in class.</p>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>This is a studio based course that introduces students to computer programming with an emphasis on creative design and data visualization. No previous programming experience is required. Students will learn techniques to translate raw data into compelling
      audio and visual projects. Through readings and discussions, the course will also unpack the roles data plays in our lives. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, students will experiment and develop their own strategies to creatively
      write code. Students will complete the class with technical skills that will lay the foundation for more advanced programming, scripting, and web development.</p>
    <p>There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
    <p class="notice">**Having your own computer is a requirement for this class**</p>
    <h2>STUDENT RESPNSIBILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS</h2>
    <p>Students are expected to be prepared at the start of each class with their laptops ready, with the required software installed, with any readings completed, and amterials to take notes. Class projects offer opportunities to guide content based upon
      individual interests. Students are invited and encouraged to interset their research interests with the course work. This class will focus on using code creatively and requires an openness and enthusiasm for artistic thinking.</p>
    <h2>COURSE GOALS</h2>
    <p>The goal of this course is to establish a foundational understanding of digital and code environments as art making tools. Through lectures, screenings, and workshops, students will learn about the social, political, and personal relationships these
      technologies form in our everyday lives. Students will also form a critical foundation through investigations into theories and histories.</p>
    <p>Basic understanding of how computers, networks, and code work</p>
    <p>A general understanding of how to read and write new media using various techniques such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Generative systems, and Art Games.</p>
    <p>Broad understanding of the political, historical, social, and creative implications of living in an interconnected virtual, electronic world. How these systems of code change the way we relate to media, and what it means to exist between the virtual
      and the physical.</p>
    <p>Leave this course with a beginner to intermediate level skill set in order to take additional new media classes. </p>
    <p>Students will learn to write code that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generates visual and audio compositions</li>
      <li>Uses input from the computer keyboard and mouse</li>
      <li>Uses information from datasets</li>
      <li>Read and learn from others' code</li>
      <li>Troubleshoot issues and learn their causes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <p>A series of projects will be announced throughout the semester supporting the course objectives. To succeed at these projects and to achieve the most from participating in the course, students must invest in the technical, conceptual, and aesthetic
      compnents of the work. Skills required for these projects will be covered through lessons, workshops, and homework assignments. Students are strongly encouraged to creatively experiment and to go above and beyond the minimum requirements for projects.</p>
    <h2>CLASS MATERIALS</h2>
    <p>Various articles and excerpts from journals, websites, and books covering topics such as critical theory, experimental new media art, data visualization, and computer graphics will be handed out in class as reading assignments. There are no required
      books you need to purchase for this class. </p>
    <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
    <p>Students must challenge themselves to grow based upon thier previous skills and experience. Students should set goals that are realistic and push themselves beyond their previous work. Projects that demonstrate attention to detail, thoughtful choices,
      and careful craft will be evaluated much higher than overly ambitious work that remains incomplete or dysfunctional. Classmates are expected to contribute to a supportive and helpful classroom environment.</p>
    <h2>GRADING</h2>
    <p>Grading is based on expectations of class participation, reading responses, and quality of work created.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">10% In Class Participation:</span> Class participation includes lab time, workshops, critiques, discussions, and an overall active engagement in class.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">10% Homework:</span> There will also be a few short homework exercises for you to complete throughout the semester. Information for each homework assignment will be given in class and listed on the class schedule.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">40% Assignments:</span> These assignments will be discussed in class and will be posted on the course website with adequate time for completion.</p>
    <p><span class="notice">40% Final:</span> The final project will consist of an artistic work or installation of your choosing utilizing the skills obtained in lab exercises and inspired by course content. Please see the homework and assignments section
      for details.</p>
    <p class="notice">Assignments submitted after the due date will be penalized one letter grade. No assignments will be accepted for credit later than one week beyond the due date.</p>
    <h2>ATTENDANCE</h2>
    <p>Attendance is mandatory. Please arrive to class on time.</p>
    <p>Students are expected to utilize class time productively. If a student leaves class early without permission from the instructor they will be marked as absent or tardy - even if it is a 'work day' in class. Three late arrivals or early departures
      is equivalent to an absence. If you are absent on critique days your assignment will be lowered by two letter grades. Critiques are an important part of class.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-Three absences &#8211; no penalty except for loss of instruction</li>
      <li>Four absences &#8211; grade lowered one letter grade
      </li>
      <li>Five absences &#8211; grade lowered an additional letter grade.</li>
      <li>Six absences &#8211; automatic failure</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>LAB HOURS</h2>
    <p>The New Media Lab has hours available for students to work on projects outside of normal class time. Lab assistants are available to give advice and troubleshooting help. Lab hours will be posted on the New Media Lab door.</p>
    <h2>IN CLASS PHONE/LAPTOP POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      Use of cell phones, laptops, iPads, etc. for texting, email, chatting, internet browsing, or any activity unrelated to what we are doing in class at that moment is a distraction to yourself and others in the class. Any student warned about inappropriate
      personal digital device usage more than twice in one class will be marked late for this day.
    </p>
    <h2>ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITIES</h2>
    <p>Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of University life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical
      environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community. UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability
      community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>
    <p>For additional information or assistance with the equal opportunity, affirmative action, and harassment policies and procedures of the University of Illinois at Chicago, please contact the <a href="http://oae.uic.edu/">Office for Access and Equity</a>.
      During the first week of the semester, a student needing accommodations for any type of disability should make an appointment with the instructor to schedule a meeting to discuss the situation and possible solutions.</p>
    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Do not leave personal belongings, cameras, equipment or other valuables unattended as this is an open access building and there have occasionally been incidents of theft. Do not prop open doors when they are locked after regular hours, especially
      the main door to the building. Consider instead posting a note or texting so a visitor can call to let you know of his/her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>If you see a suspicious person who does not seem to be School student or faculty, call UIC Police and ask them to check on the situation. There are red “Call Police” buttons positioned throughout the building.
    </p>
    <p>UIC POLICE NUMBER: 1-312-355-5555 or 312-996-2830</p>
    <h2>SHARED SPACE</h2>
    <p>As a member of the UIC Art community, you have 24-hour access to the studios and other spaces. Please treat the spaces with respect. Clean up if you mess up tables, walls, or floor with food or art supplies. Throw away your trash after class each
      day. If the spaces in studios, hallways or other areas are changed by an art installation or work process you are responsible for restoring space to original conditions. For the safety of fellow students as well as equipment and spaces do not prop
      open doors or allow unauthorized people to enter the building.</p>
    <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>Projects created in this course may be used by the Department for purposes of promotion for students, the Department, or the University in general. The Department may also use these materials for instructional purposes in future courses. The Instructor
      may also use your projects as examples of work completed in the class.</p>
