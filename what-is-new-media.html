        "...a metamedium, whose content would be a wide range of already-existing and not-yet-invented media."
        <div class="author">-Alan Kay &amp; Adele Goldberg </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Old media can be inserted and reconfigured within digital space and become something else and new. For example, you can digitize a text, then cut, copy, paste, find...analyze it with a computer.
      </p>


      <p>
        New media also consists of not yet invented media, software and hardware that reinterpret it. Examples of this might be social media, 3D scanning, MMORPG, etc.

      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        "new media” is “new” because new properties (i.e., new software techniques) can be easily added to it.

      <h1>Principles of New Media</h1>
      <p class="center"> From <span class="bookTitle">The Language of New Media</span> by: Lev Manovich
        <p><span class="term">Numerical Representation:</span> "All new media objects, whether created from scratch on computers or converted from analog media sources, are composed of digital code; they are numerical representations."</p>

        <p>

          New Media == 01001110 01100101 01110111 00100000 01001101 01100101 01100100 01101001 01100001

        </p>
        <p><span class="term">Modularity:</span> "Media elements, be they images, sounds, shapes, or behaviors, are represented as collections of discrete samples (pixels, polygons, voxels, characters, scripts). These elements are assembled into larger-scale
          objects but continue to maintain their separate identities. The objects themselves can be combined into even larger objects—again, without losing their independence."
        </p>


        <p><span class="term">Automation:</span> "The numerical coding of media (principle 1) and the modular structure of media objects (principle 2) allow for the automation of many operations involved in media creation, manipulation and access."
        </p>


        <p><span class="term">Variability</span> "A new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that can exist in different, potentially infinite versions. This is another sequence of the numerical coding of media (principle 1)
          and the modular structure of a media object (principle 2)."

      <h1>New Media Evolution</h1>
      <p>
        <p class="quote">

          "New Media art and older categorical names like "Digital art," "Computer art," "Multimedia art," and "Interactive art" are often used interchangeably, but for the purposes of this book (class) we use the term New Media art to describe projects that make
          use of emerging media technologies and are concerned with the cultural, political, and aesthetic possibilities of these tools. We locate New Media art as a subset of two broader categories: Art and Technology and Media art. Art and Technology
          refers to practices, such as Electronic art, Robotic art, and Genomic art, that involve technologies which are new but not necessarily mediarelated. Media art includes Video art, Transmission art, and Experimental Film art forms that incorporate
          media technologies which by the 1990s were no longer new. New Media art is thus the intersection of these two domains."

      <p> New Media can be a contentious name because it is always changing and adapting. It's a fluid development.

      <h1>New Media Environments (We Love New Media and Corporations Love Us)</h1>


      <p>
        Software and digital tools are not neutral; they are embedded with the ideologies and politics of their creator. Whether that be completely free and open sourced software (HTML), a controlled and automated space (Facebook), or controlled hardware (Apple).
      </p>



      <div>

        <p class="quote">
          "We Facebook users have been building a treasure lode of big data that government and corporate researchers have been mining to predict and influence what we buy and for whom we vote. We have been handing over to them vast quantities of information about
          ourselves and our friends, loved ones and acquaintances." "Everything we do in the digital realm - from surfing the Web to sending an e-mail to conducting a credit card transaction to, yes, making a phone call - creates a data trail. And if
          that trail exists, chances are someone is using it - or will be soon enough."

          "All media work us over completely. They are so persuasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the massage.
          Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. All media are extensions of some human faculty – psychic or physical.”

      <h2>The Posthuman Condition</h2>

      <div>


        <p class="quote">
          "If my nightmare is a culture inhabited by posthumans who regard their bodies as fashion accessories rather than the ground of being, my dream is a version of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information technologies without being seduced
          by fantasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality, that recognizes and celebrates finitude as a condition of human being, and that understands human life is embedded in a material world of great complexity, one on which we depend for
          our continued survival.”
